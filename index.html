            <h2>BRAD THOMPSON JR.</h2>
            <h3>aka TOMMY THOMPSON</h3>
            <p>Creative Strategist | Designer | Musician | Digital Architect | Social Media Marketing | Product Fulfillment</p>
            <p><strong>Project PLUS</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <p>Representing Design Team Lucci, I’m Brad Thompson Jr., a multi-disciplinary creative operating at the
                intersection of design, strategy, music, and emerging tech. I don’t just create—I build systems, tell
                stories, and launch ideas with speed and clarity. From streetwear collections and music rollouts to
                portfolio design and AI-integrated campaigns, I’ve used mobile-first tools and sharp creative insight to
                push every project beyond the expected.</p>
            <p>This portfolio—Project PLUS—is more than a collection of work. It’s a living archive of ideas executed
                fast, with vision and heart, often without the traditional infrastructure. That’s the point. I turn
                constraint into momentum and deliver on time.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>CORE APPROACH: MOBILE-FIRST, PRO-READY</h3>
            <p>I’m fluent in Photoshop, Illustrator, Final Cut Pro, and other traditional software, but my intentional
                focus on mobile tools gives me the edge. I meet your customers where they are. I use iPhone, iPad,
                macOS, and iOS-native apps like Procreate Pocket, CapCut, GarageBand, and other mobile-friendly
                platforms to move quickly and independently. I build for you from idea to inception.</p>
            <p>Why? Because most clients have more budget than time. My process allows me to build, revise, and deliver
                without delays, while still keeping quality high. The goal is to lead fast-moving creative initiatives
                from anywhere, and I’ve proven it again and again.</p>
            <p>Mobile isn’t a shortcut—it’s strategy.</p>

            <h3>PROJECT HIGHLIGHT: COUNTUP – The Bag Chasers Collection</h3>
            <p>Role: Lead Designer, Brand Strategist, Creative Director</p>
            <p>When CountUpD sent me a post teasing his new clothing line, I took initiative. I turned that mockup into
                a full design blueprint, coordinated with overseas production, created visuals, and crafted the
                rollout—all before the first sample arrived.</p>
            <p>What I did:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed the COUNTUP logo, ‘Chase Racks’ tee, ‘Kid Counting Money’ tee</li>
                <li>Led production through Motoma Industries in Pakistan</li>
                <li>Styled lookbooks, AI-enhanced previews, Procreate artwork, sleeve appliqué placements</li>
                <li>Directed photo shoots, managed revisions, and built social-ready content</li>
                <li>Engaged independent manufacturing for custom prototypes and product lines</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This was a case study in how far I can push a brand visually and strategically, solo. I’m using COUNTUP
                to demonstrate how I build brands from scratch with no excuses. Again, no shortcuts taken. I dove
                completely into leveraging their brand identity to create a strong, cohesive, highly stylish product
                line that reflects their target market.</p>

            <h3>PROJECT HIGHLIGHT: UNKNOWNPLANETDOTORG</h3>
            <p>Role: Founder, Creative Director, Music Producer</p>
            <p>UNKNOWNPLANETDOTORG is a boutique label and experimental platform I launched to release eclectic hip-hop
                and soul records from artists like Jay Gray, Spinforth, and myself.</p>
            <p>What I built:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple music videos shot and edited with iPhone and AI filters</li>
                <li>Visual branding and rollouts for singles like “Rappers Need to Shut the F Up,” “Legit Flow,” and
                    “The Procedure”</li>
                <li>Collaborations with JMJ Records artists and licensing talks with WHOMAG Distribution</li>
                <li>80/20 artist deal structure that puts creators first while recognizing behind-the-scenes labor</li>
                <li>Established international product sales and distribution without compromising intellectual property
                </li>
                <li>Ad hoc multi genre music production for both well known and underground artists/groups</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This project isn’t just music—it’s a model for independent media done right.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>I’m not just trying to go viral. I’m trying to build something real, something that lasts.</li>

            <li>The work I do reflects my belief in presence, speed, and intention.</li>
                <li>Whether I’m reflecting deep themes in a four-panel comic or helping a small brand look like a powerhouse overnight, it’s always about impact.</li>
                <li></li>Everything is done with integrity and forethought. Principled, focused creative design drives everything
                I do.</li>
