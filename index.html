            <h3>aka TOMMY THOMPSON</h3>
            <p>Creative Strategist | Designer | Musician | Digital Architect | Social Media Marketing | Product Fulfillment</p>

        <section>
            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <p>Representing Design Team Lucci, I’m Brad Thompson Jr., a multi-disciplinary creative operating at the intersection of
            design, strategy, music, and emerging tech. I don’t just create—I build systems, tell stories, and launch ideas with
            speed and clarity. From streetwear collections and music rollouts to portfolio design and AI-integrated campaigns, I’ve
            used mobile-first tools and sharp creative insight to push every project beyond the expected.
            
            This portfolio—Project PLUS—is more than a collection of work. It’s a living archive of ideas executed fast, with vision
            and heart, often without the traditional infrastructure. That’s the point. I turn constraint into momentum and deliver
            on time.</p>

            <h3>CORE APPROACH: MOBILE-FIRST, PRO-READY</h3>
            <p>I’m fluent in Photoshop, Illustrator, Final Cut Pro, and other traditional software, but my intentional focus on mobile
            tools gives me the edge. I meet your customers where they are. I use iPhone, iPad, macOS, and iOS-native apps like
            Procreate Pocket, CapCut, GarageBand, and other mobile-friendly platforms to move quickly and independently. I build for
            you from idea to inception.
            
            Why? Because most clients have more budget than time. My process allows me to build, revise, and deliver without delays,
            while still keeping quality high. The goal is to lead fast-moving creative initiatives from anywhere, and I’ve proven it
            again and again.
            
            Mobile isn’t a shortcut—it’s strategy.</p>

            <h3>PROJECT HIGHLIGHT: COUNTUP – The Bag Chasers Collection</h3>
            <p>Role: Lead Designer, Brand Strategist, Creative Director</p>
            <p>When CountUpD sent me a post teasing his new clothing line, I took initiative. I turned that mockup into a full design
            blueprint, coordinated with overseas production, created visuals, and crafted the rollout—all before the first sample
            arrived.
            
            What I did:
            – Designed the COUNTUP logo, ‘Chase Racks’ tee, ‘Kid Counting Money’ tee
            – Led production through Motoma Industries in Pakistan
            – Styled lookbooks, AI-enhanced previews, Procreate artwork, sleeve appliqué placements
            – Directed photo shoots, managed revisions, and built social-ready content
            – Engaged independent manufacturing for custom prototypes and product lines
            
            This was a case study in how far I can push a brand visually and strategically, solo. I’m using COUNTUP to demonstrate
            how I build brands from scratch with no excuses. Again, no shortcuts taken. I dove completely into leveraging their
            brand identity to create a strong, cohesive, highly stylish product line that reflects their target market.</p>

            <h3>PROJECT HIGHLIGHT: UNKNOWNPLANETDOTORG</h3>
            <p>Role: Founder, Creative Director, Music Producer</p>
            <p>UNKNOWNPLANETDOTORG is a boutique label and experimental platform I launched to release eclectic hip-hop and soul
            records from artists like Jay Gray, Spinforth, and myself.
            
            What I built:
            – Multiple music videos shot and edited with iPhone and AI filters
            – Visual branding and rollouts for singles like “Rappers Need to Shut the F Up,” “Legit Flow,” and “The Procedure”
            – Collaborations with JMJ Records artists and licensing talks with WHOMAG Distribution
            – 80/20 artist deal structure that puts creators first while recognizing behind-the-scenes labor– Established
            international product sales and distribution without compromising intellectual property
            – Ad hoc multi genre music production for both well known and underground artists/groups
            
            This project isn’t just music—it’s a model for independent media done right.</p>
